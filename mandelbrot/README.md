# mandelbrot
## controls
* hjkl for movement
* d and f to zoom in and out respectively
* x to increase the escape constant

I know, the code is spaghetti, runs slow and needs support for arrow keys but I'm busy today. :<
Anyways, this is my first program in opengl. Hope you like it

## dependencies
* [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm)
* ~~[galogen](https://github.com/google/galogen) only necessary if you want another opengl version for some reason~~
* [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
